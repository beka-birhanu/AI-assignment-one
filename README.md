# Search Algorithms Performance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains scripts for analyzing the performance of various search algorithms. There are two main scripts available:

1. **romania.py**: This script demonstrates the implementation of various search algorithms on the graph representing the map of Romania. Additionally, it performs centrality analysis on the cities of Romania, calculating multiple centrality measures including degree centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, pagerank centrality, katz centrality, and betweenness centrality.

2. **algorithms_graph_analysis.py**: This script analyzes the performance of search algorithms using randomly generated graphs. It plots the performance of each algorithm based on different graph configurations.

## Usage

### Romania Map Analysis

To see the search algorithms in action on the Romania map:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the `romania.py` script using Python 3:

### Performance Analysis with Random Graphs

To analyze the performance of search algorithms using randomly generated graphs:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the `algorithms_graph_analysis.py` script using Python 3:

## Dependencies

Both scripts require Python 3 and the following dependencies:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

## Note

Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system before running the scripts.

For any questions or issues, feel free to contact the repository owner.

Happy analyzing!
